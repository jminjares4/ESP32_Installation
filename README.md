The script was develop based on the guidelines of: https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html#step-1-install-prerequisites

# '''NOTE'''
* If you plan to ues esp-idf frequently, you can create an alias for executing export.sh:
Copy and paste the following command to your shellâ€™s profile (.profile, .bashrc, .zprofile, etc.)

** alias get_idf='. $HOME/esp/esp-idf/export.sh' **

*Refresh the configuration by restarting the terminal session or by running source [path to profile], for example, source ~/.bashrc.

Now you can run get_idf to set up or refresh the esp-idf environment in any terminal session.
